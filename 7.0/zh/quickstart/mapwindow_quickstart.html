<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1>1. Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This quickstart provides an introduction to a limited set of the functionality
provided by MapWindow GIS v4.8.6 and it provides instructions on how to accomplish
a suite of basic GIS tasks. My aim is to provide an easy-to-follow guide for users that are mainly interested in displaying GIS
data, conducting simple queries, and exporting high quality maps for use in publications and
presentations. This being the case, not all of the functionality of MapWindow is covered. In
particular, the guide only covers the main program and not the plug-ins (except for the shapefile
editor).</p>
<p>The MapWindow desktop software is available for free download as a single ready-to-install
.exe file from the MapWindow website: www.mapwindow.org. MapWindow is a <strong>native Windows</strong>
application that requires installation of the Microsoft .NET framework. It runs on XP, Vista, and
Windows 7 and works fine on 64-bit machines. The program is quite intuitive to use and new users
will be up and running quickly. With only a couple of exceptions it provides a user experience
that meets or exceeds that of ArcMap, for the procedures covered in this guide.</p>
<p>The MapWindow desktop program that is the focus of this guide is just one part of a larger
open-source project. The core software is also available as an ActiveX component, allowing
programmers to develop customized GIS applications. It is also possible for advanced users to
modify and extend the desktop program to fit individual needs. More information on the MapWindow
project and its various facets can be obtained from the MapWindow website.</p>
<p>Because MapWindow is under continuous development it may not behave exactly as described in
this guide if you are using a newer version of the program. A web-based users guide is under
development in the MapWindow website and you might want to have a look there if you are running
into problems or want information on functions not covered here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-started">
<h1>2. Getting Started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="projects">
<h2>2.1 Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#projects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The project file maintains a record of the different layers, labels, colors and
styles you have defined for your map. When MapWindow starts it initiates a new project. You can
also start a new project at any time by clicking the
<strong>New</strong> toolbar button. Any changes that you make to a project are not stored until
you click the
<strong>Save</strong> toolbar button, or save when prompted on exit. Previous projects are accessed
by clicking the
<strong>Open</strong> toolbar button or selecting
<strong>File</strong> from the top menu and clicking
<strong>Recent Projects</strong>. You can also double click on the project file name in Windows Explorer,
which opens the project in a new instance of MapWindow. Project files carry the extension .mwprj.</p>
<p>Besides saving the layers and related symbology the project file stores a few
additional settings such as map units, projections, and so on. These can be accessed by selecting
the <strong>File</strong> menu and clicking on
<strong>Settings</strong>. Users will generally not have to make any changes to these settings so they
will not be discussed here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plug-ins">
<h2>2.2 Plug-ins<a class="headerlink" href="#plug-ins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The installation program installs a
number of core plug-ins, such
<strong>Shapefile Editor</strong>, that provide additional functionality to the base program.
Additional plug-ins are available from the MapWindow website. To install a new plug-in download
the zip file and extract it to the MapWindow plug-in folder, usually C:\Program
Files\MapWindow\Plugins. Sometimes the plug-in is a single .dll, but it can also be a folder
containing multiple files in which case the whole folder goes into \MapWindow\Plugins.</p>
<p>Before you can use any of the plug-ins they have to be activated within MapWindow. To do
this select
<strong>Plug-ins</strong> from the main menu and click on the plug-in you wish to activate. It
will remain activated, even in new projects, until you click it again. Once a plug-in is
activated a new toolbar button or menu item will be displayed enabling you to use it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-data-layers">
<h2>2.3 Adding data layers<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-data-layers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The maps you produce will
usually be composed of several GIS data layers. These layers are adding either by dragging and
dropping files from Windows Explorer onto the map display window or by clicking the
<strong>Add</strong> toolbar button. Each layer that is added is listed in the legend window (use
<strong>View -&gt; Panels -&gt; Show Legend</strong> if it is not visible). Double clicking the layer in
the legend or clicking the
<strong>Properties</strong> toolbar button will bring up the
<strong>Layer properties</strong> dialog which has several tabs for making changes to a layers
properties. For example, to change the name displayed in the legend select the
<strong>General</strong> tab and modify the text in the
<strong>Name</strong> textbox. Other properties will be dealt with in subsequent sections. To
remove a map layer click the
<strong>Remove</strong> toolbar button. Clicking the
<strong>Clear</strong> toolbar button will remove all map layers.</p>
<p>The colored icons displayed in the legend illustrate the type of data in the layers
(polygon, line or point) and the current symbology. The order of the layers in the legend
determines the overlay order in the map: layers that are higher in the list cover layers that are
lower. If a layer seems to be missing it might be because it is completely covered by other
layers. To change the order of a layer just click and drag it to where you want it to go. A small
checkbox beside each legend entry allow you to turn the display of individual map layers on and
off.</p>
<p>MapWindow will display different kinds of GIS data, including: vectors (polygons, lines,
and points), rasters (rectangular grids of data), and images. Many different file formats are
supported, including .shp, .asc, .aux, .bgd, .bil, .dem, dt1, .hdr, .img, .jpg, .sid, .std, .tif
and others. The ESRI shapefile (.shp) is the vector format used by MapWindow when generating new
vector files. It uses GeoTiff and the .bgd format when generating new raster files.</p>
<p>To add a scale to your map open the
<strong>View</strong> menu and select
<strong>Show Floating Scale Bar</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="projections">
<h2>2.4 Projections<a class="headerlink" href="#projections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A projection is a mathematical
transformation used to display the 3-dimensional earth onto your 2-dimensional computer screen.
Different projections are available, each with its own benefits, costs, and appropriate uses. A
detailed discussion of projections is beyond the scope of this guide, but a few basic points need
to be covered. The main issue is that the various layers in your project all need to use the same
projection if the overlays are to line up. In MapWindow, the projection of a layer is defined in
a supplemental file carrying the .prj extension. This is a common format for projections, also
used in ArcMap. A layers projection can be viewed in the
<strong>General</strong> tab of the
<strong>Layer Properties</strong> dialog, which is opened by double-clicking the layer in the
legend or clicking the
<strong>Properties</strong> toolbar button</p>
<p>The first map that you add to a project defines the projection for the entire project. Each
subsequent layer must have the same projection or MapWindow will display a warning dialog. This
dialog allows you to reproject the incoming layer, or do nothing (in which case the layers may be
misaligned). Note that reprojecting a layer involves more than just changing the contents of the
.prj file, there are also changes to the shape of the polygons. Therefore, it is best to
reproject to a new file, rather than overwriting the old. If a map layer is missing the .prj file
it will be necessary to define a projection for it. This can be done in MapWindow using the
<strong>Toolbox</strong>, but the process is outside the scope of this guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basic-toolbar-functions">
<h2>2.5 Basic toolbar functions<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-toolbar-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A suite of basic map
functions is accessed through a set of toolbar buttons. Their use is quite intuitive so only a
brief explanation is provided here. Note that several functions require the user to first select
a target layer, which is done by clicking it in the legend. You can move the toolbars (click and
drag at the dotted line) and the text labels can be toggled on and off via right-click.</p>

<div class="section" id="defining-symbology-vectors">
<h2>3.1 Defining symbology: vectors<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-symbology-vectors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you first add a layer all shapes are given the same
color and outline. MapWindow has two dialogs for customizing the symbology (color scheme,
outlines, style, etc.). One is the <strong>Layer Properties</strong> dialog, which can be accessed by double-clicking the layer in
the legend.</p>
<img alt="Categories toolbar button" class="align-right" src="../../_images/mapwindow-categories.png" style="width: 76px; height: 51px;" />
<p>The other is the <strong>Categories</strong> toolbar button. They both work much the same way. I will describe the
<strong>Categories</strong> button here because I prefer using it.</p>
<div class="section" id="unique-values">
<h3>3.1.1 Unique values<a class="headerlink" href="#unique-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<img alt="Categories generation" class="align-right" src="../../_images/mapwindow-button-plus.png" style="width: 56px; height: 48px;" />
<p>If your layer is made of shapes that represent distinct entities, say herds of
caribou, then proceed as follows. Click the
<strong>Categories</strong> toolbar button to bring up the
<strong>Symbology</strong> dialog. It will be empty when you begin, indicating that no symbology
has been defined. Next, click the
<strong>Generate Categories</strong> button (bottom left) to bring up the
<strong>Category generation</strong> dialog. Follow the steps below to assign colors based on the
attribute of your choice.</p>
<img alt="Categories generation" class="align-right" src="../../_images/mapwindow-category-generation.png" style="width: 502px; height: 573px;" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Under <strong>Classification type</strong> select <strong>Unique values</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Classification field</strong> select the attribute you want to use for assigning different colors to shapes</li>
<li><strong>Color scheme</strong> is used to select the color palette for your shapes. Click the triangle to the right to select a different palette. The option button on the far right can be used to edit the palettes and define new ones.</li>
<li>If <strong>Choose color randomly</strong> is <strong>not</strong> checked, colors are sequentially assigned from left to right across the entire palette.</li>
<li>If <strong>Set gradient</strong> is checked a gradient from dark to light is applied to <em>each polygon</em>. This effect is really only apparent when polygons are large.</li>
<li>The other entries in the dialog are not used for unique values.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Ok</strong> to finish</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="continuous-data">
<h3>3.1.2 Continuous data<a class="headerlink" href="#continuous-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If your layer contains continuous data, say the height of trees within stands, then you
must define categories into which the shapes are assigned. Begin by opening the
<strong>Category generation</strong> dialog and selecting the classification field and color
scheme as described in 3.1.1 Set the number of categories you want in the
<strong>Number of categories</strong> box. Then, under
<strong>Classification type</strong> select one of three methods for defining the category
breakpoints:
<strong>Equal intervals</strong>,
<strong>Natural breaks</strong>, and
<strong>Quantiles</strong>. These options will only be available if the classification field
contains numeric data (use
<strong>Unique values</strong> for text). Click
<strong>Ok</strong> to complete the process.</p>
<p>If you wish to display the categories using a color ramp, say light red for low values
grading to dark red for high values, select a smoothly grading color palette from the list of
palette options (see example below). Do not check the
<strong>Set gradient</strong> option because this refers to color gradients
<strong>within</strong> polygons, something else entirely.</p>
<p>If your data layer is comprised of lines or points it may make more sense to illustrate
gradients using symbol size (e.g., increasing line thickness or point size) rather than a color
ramp. To do this place a check in the
<strong>Use variable line width</strong> checkbox and then define the minimum and maximum symbol
size in the option boxes below. Symbol size will be based on whatever attribute is selected in
<strong>Classification field</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customizing-the-symbology">
<h3>3.1.3 Customizing the symbology<a class="headerlink" href="#customizing-the-symbology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<img alt="Categories toolbar button" class="align-right" src="../../_images/mapwindow-categories.png" style="width: 76px; height: 51px;" />
<p>Once a color scheme has been generated, the categories and color assignments appear in the
<strong>Shapefile categories</strong> dialog and in the legend. Further editing is possible from
either location. For simple changes the fastest and easiest approach is to click on the color you
want to change in the legend. But the dialog which opens with the
<strong>Categories</strong> toolbar button has a few more options so I will focus on it here.</p>
<img alt="Shapefile categories" src="../../_images/mapwindow-shapefile-categories.png" style="width: 831px; height: 507px;" />
<p>In the <strong>Shapefile categories</strong> dialog, select the category you wish to change by clicking
on its name or color. Then:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Turn the display of the category on and off using the checkbox to the left of the name</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Change the categorys name by typing over the existing text in the <strong>Name</strong> column (this only changes the legend entry; no changes are made to the attribute table)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Change the order that a category is listed in the legend using the up and down arrow buttons at the bottom of the dialog</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Remove the category from the map by clicking the button with a minus sign</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Set basic options for fill color and fill style using the option boxes in the top right corner of the dialog</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Set additional options by clicking the <strong>More options</strong> button or by double-clicking on the categorys color box:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Show or hide the fill, outline, and vertices</li>
<li>Select the color and transparency level for fill, outline, and vertices</li>
<li>Define the fill type</li>
<li>Set the outline width and style</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Making the top layer partially transparent is a useful way of displaying features that lie
beneath.</p>
<p>If you are working with continuous data you may want to fine-tune the category break
points. For example, you may wish to flag all shapes that have a zero value with a unique color
but display the rest of your data using a smooth color gradient. None of the classification
schemes in the
<strong>Category generation</strong> dialog will do this for you automatically. However, you can
specify the breakpoints for each category manually using the
<strong>Expression</strong> window of the dialog. The
<strong>Expression</strong> window displays the current breakpoints in the form of a selection
expression. Changing the breakpoints is simply a matter of typing new values into this expression
and clicking
<strong>Apply</strong>. It is up to you to ensure that your changes dont result in gaps between
categories.</p>
<img alt="Categories in the legend" class="align-right" src="../../_images/mapwindow-legend.png" style="width: 156px; height: 143px;" />
<p>It is worth noting something here that can lead to unexpected results:when you generate categories,
the original default symbology remains lurking in the background. In the example legend shown to
the right a red color ramp has been assigned to the categories, but the original default color (blue)
is still there too. Normally this is not an issue because all shapes are displayed using the
category scheme. But if you manually define breakpoints and leave any gaps between categories the
unassigned shapes will be seen in the default color. Another thing to keep in mind is that the
default symbology is used as the template for generating categories. If you dont want your
categories to have outlines, turn the outline off in the default symbology before generating the
categories. Likewise, if you want the categories to have a fill, make sure it is visible in the
default scheme first.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="defining-symbology-rasters">
<h2>3.2 Defining symbology: rasters<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-symbology-rasters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="Coloring scheme editor" class="align-right" src="../../_images/mapwindow-coloringscheme-editor.png" style="width: 380px; height: 400px;" />
<p>Raster layers use a different symbology dialog, called the
<strong>Legend Editor</strong>, which is left over from an earlier version of MapWindow. To open
the
<strong>Legend Editor</strong> double-click on the layer in the legend. Scroll down to the
Symbology section of the dialog and in the row labeled
<strong>Coloring Scheme</strong> click
<strong>Edit</strong> to bring up the
<strong>Coloring Scheme Editor</strong>.</p>
<p>The buttons along the top of this dialog have basically the same functionality as the
buttons along on the bottom of the
<strong>Symbology</strong> dialog described in 3.1. The
<strong>Generate categories</strong> button is called
<strong>Wizard</strong> here, and takes the form of a yellow lightning bolt. It has a similar set
of options and works in basically the same way. But only the
<strong>Continuous Ramp</strong> option allows you to preselect your color scheme.</p>
<p>To change the color of a category just click on it in the
<strong>Coloring Scheme Editor</strong> There is no option to display outlines for raster cells.
The text that is displayed in the legend can be changed via the
<strong>Text</strong> column and the breakpoint values can be manually changed via the
<strong>Value</strong> column. Hillshade is outside of the scope of this guide.</p>
<p>Transparency is set in the
<strong>Legend Editor</strong>, four rows down from
<strong>Coloring Scheme</strong>. If a raster is sufficiently fine-scaled, transparency can be
used to effectively combine information from the raster with other layers. To do this, move the
raster to the top of the legend, assign a black to white color ramp, and set the transparency to
about 50%. Whatever layer is beneath the raster will now be shaded according the rasters values.
For example, a vector map of ecosystem types could be shaded on the basis of elevation, with
lower elevations being darker and higher elevations being lighter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-labels">
<h2>3.3 Adding labels<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-labels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Labels are added using the
<strong>Labels</strong> tab of the
<strong>Layer Properties</strong> dialog, which is opened by double-clicking the layer in the
legend. When you first open this dialog the label preview window will be empty. Click on the
<strong>Setup</strong> button to proceed (see the screen shot on the next page). Clicking on the
small label icon to the right of the layers name in the legend opens the same dialog. The
<strong>Setup</strong> button brings up the
<strong>Label Style</strong> dialog, defaulting to the
<strong>Expression</strong> tab. The first step is to select the attribute that holds the label
values. The available attributes are listed in the
<strong>Fields</strong> window. Double-click on the appropriate attribute and it will show up in
the
<strong>Expression</strong> window, indicating that it has been selected. Click
<strong>Apply</strong> and a pop-up will ask you how you want to anchor the labels.</p>
<img alt="Label set-up" class="align-right" src="../../_images/mapwindow-labels-setup.png" style="width: 833px; height: 507px;" />
<img alt="Label expression" class="align-right" src="../../_images/mapwindow-label-expression.png" style="width: 833px; height: 507px;" />
<p>Next, open the
<strong>Font</strong> tab and select a font. Note that the default font may not be set, so you
might not see anything until you assign the font here. Click
<strong>Apply</strong> and the labels will appear on your map. The
<strong>Label style</strong> dialog has many other options you can use to customize your labels,
but none are mandatory. These options are fairly self-explanatory. Click
<strong>Ok</strong> to finish.</p>
<p>Once labels have been generated you can change the text and style of individual entries by
clicking on the
<strong>Categories</strong> toolbar button. A new tab called
<strong>Labels</strong> is now available (i.e., once labels have been defined). Initially it is

label categories using the same approach as for generating symbology categories (Sec 3.1). Then
use the rest of the dialog in the same way as described for the

<h2>3.5 Exporting a map<a class="headerlink" href="#exporting-a-map" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="low-resolution-export">
<h3>3.5.1 Low resolution export<a class="headerlink" href="#low-resolution-export" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>MapWindow provides two quick ways to export low-resolution maps. The first uses the Windows
clipboard: open the
<strong>View</strong> menu and select
<strong>Copy</strong>. You can copy the map, legend, scale bar, and north arrow. In the second
approach the same map components are exported to a file. Open the
<strong>File</strong> menu and select
<strong>Export</strong>. A wide variety of export file formats are available. For most maps the
.png format will be best. When colors are uniform, as they typically are in maps, the .png format
provides a high degree of compression without any changes to the image (i.e., lossless
compression). To specify the export format just add the appropriate extension to your file name
(e.g., Map1.png).</p>
<p>The low-resolution export described here is equivalent to a screen dump of the main map
window. Note that the
<strong>Preview Map</strong>, if you are using it, plays no role here. If there is a lot of white
space in the main window, your exported map will have lots of white space. If you have minimized
MapWindow (instead of running full screen), the map you produce will be small (basically a 1:1
ratio with what you see on the screen). The resolution of the map is equivalent to the resolution
of your computer screen. This being the case, the exported maps are ok for use in PowerPoint but
not for printing. Even though the map may look ok in Microsoft Word when its up on your screen,
the image quality on paper will be poor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preparing-a-publication-quality-map">
<h3>3.5.2 Preparing a publication-quality map<a class="headerlink" href="#preparing-a-publication-quality-map" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once you have your map looking the way you like it there are still a few steps required to
prepare it for publication. As an example, say you are preparing a research paper or brochure and
you want to add a map that will fit into a single column of text 7cm wide. The map you produce
should have a resolution of 300 dpi (print quality) and fit into the allotted 7cm with a minimum
of white space around it. It should also include an appropriate legend and perhaps a scale bar
and north arrow. The
<strong>Print Layout</strong> dialog, accessed under the
<strong>File</strong> menu is intended to facilitate this process, but it is really just designed
for printing, not publishing (i.e., the layout cannot be saved as a digital image). Also, the
output resolution cannot be specified (just high and low), no modifications can be made to the
legend, and there are limited options for defining a bounding box. This being the case, the best
option (at present) for generating a publication quality map is to do some of the work in an
image editor like Photoshop.</p>
<p>The first step in preparing your map for export is to define a bounding box for it. Do this
by creating a simple rectangular shapefile that provides the margins you would like to see around
your map (see 4.3). This layer must be included in your project, but it does not have to be
visible. As an alternative you can use one of the existing layers in your project to define the
map extent, but be aware that the output map will be tight-cropped (i.e., no margins). The
practicality of defining a bounding box comes into play if you generate multiple maps with the
same extent although margins can be added in Photoshop its tiring to have to do so for each and
every map.</p>
<img alt="Export map" class="align-right" src="../../_images/mapwindow-export.png" style="width: 406px; height: 260px;" />
<p>Next, open
<strong>Export</strong>, under the
<strong>File</strong> menu and select
<strong>Georeferenced Map</strong> from the list of options. In the dialog that pops up enter a
name for the map you are exporting in the
<strong>File</strong> box. Remember to include the extension for the file type you want (e.g.,
.png). For
<strong>Clip to layer</strong> select the layer that is to serve as your bounding box. If you
havent defined a bounding box enter the layer with the largest extent. For
<strong>Width</strong>, enter the desired width of your map in pixels. The value you enter here
will depend on your desired resolution and your desired width. You will find that, in addition to
your exported map, a second file with a .wld extension is generated during the export. This file can be deleted.</p>
<p>Export the legend, scale bar, and north arrow, as described in the previous section
(3.5.1). Unfortunately, there is no way to generate high-resolution versions of these map
elements in the current version of MapWindow. Frankly, I find the legend export to be of limited
use anyway because there is no way to customize it (except for changing the layer names).
Therefore, I generally produce my legend within Photoshop using a high resolution template I have
made for this purpose. Producing a legend is simply a matter of adding the template to the base
map, moving it to the right spot, changing the colors, and revising the text. It takes only a
couple of minutes and produces a much better result than the cluttered low-resolution legend
exported by MapWindow.</p>

<p>A word of caution. Many of the
dialogs and processes discussed in this section can result in changes to your GIS data. MapWindow
provides few warnings to alert you to such changes and the undo functionality is not yet working.
Given the absence of a good safety net you should proceed carefully. For example, using Windows
Explorer you might set the properties of important map layers to Read Only, or choose to work
with copies instead of original maps.</p>

<img alt="Table editor" class="align-right" src="../../_images/mapwindow-table.png" style="width: 58px; height: 50px;" />
<p>Vector maps are linked to
an attribute table that contains information for each shape. For example, if the shapes are
forest stands the attribute table might include information on vegetation type, age, height, and
so on. When you use the
<strong>Identify</strong> toolbar button you are viewing information from the attribute table. To
view the entire attribute table click the
<strong>Table</strong> toolbar button, which brings up the
<strong>Attribute Table Editor</strong>. This dialog allows you to view the data and also
provides some basic database functionality. Some useful database functions provided by the table
editor are summarized below.</p>

<p>If changes have been made to the table a warning dialog will appear when the table editor
is closed.
<strong>Yes</strong> means commit the changes and
<strong>No</strong> means discard the changes.</p>
<p>A feature that is missing in the current version of MapWindow is the ability to link
external datasets to the attribute table (like Joins &amp;amp; Relates in ArcMap). Therefore, if you
want to categorize and display shapes on the basis of an external attribute you must physically
add the new attribute to the shapefiles attribute table. This can be done with a query in
Microsoft Access or other database program. You can also use Excel, but unless you have an older
version you will need to add a plug-in to Excel to provide support for .dbf export (.dbf is the
file format that MapWindow and ArcMap use for the attribute table). A source for this plug-in is:
<a class="reference external" href="http://es.sourceforge.jp/projects/sfnet_exceltodbf/">http://es.sourceforge.jp/projects/sfnet_exceltodbf/</a> The merge can also be done using the
<strong>Import External Data</strong> option of the
<strong>Swift-D</strong> plug-in of MapWindow (though its slow). The attribute table editor has a
tool called
<strong>Generate MWShape ID field</strong> that can help you maintain the correct order in the
table when you are merging external data.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-select-toolbar-button">
<h3>4.2.1 The Select toolbar button<a class="headerlink" href="#the-select-toolbar-button" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ** select** button is used to manually select shapes. The target layer must first be
selected in the legend. Click on a shape to select it. To add additional shapes hold Ctrl while
clicking. If Ctrl is not held, then clicking a shape will cause any previous selections to be
removed. In the current version of MapWindow there no way of unselecting individual shapes (all
or none). To select a block of shapes click and draw a bounding box in the desired region.</p>

for. When the expression is complete click
** select**. You are given the option of adding to an existing selection, excluding

<p>The attribute table can be used to both view and define selections. To view only
selected shapes click the
<strong>Show only selected shapes</strong> button, found in the toolbar near the top of the table
editor. Click this button again to view all records. To select a record click the grey rectangle
at the far left of the table. The record will be highlighted, indicating that it has been
selected. Use the standard Windows shift-click to select multiple consecutive records, or just
click and drag the mouse along the left. Use Ctrl-click to select multiple non-consecutive
records. Clicking the
<strong>Apply</strong> button is not required to make a selection.</p>
<p>Several important selection functions are found under the
** selection** menu, including: invert selection, select none, and select all. This
menu is also where the option to export selected features is found. Export means create a new
shapefile identical to the current layer but containing only the selected features. This is a
useful way of producing derivative maps.</p>
<p>If the layer contains a large number of shapes it may be difficult to see a selected shape.
You can zoom to the selected shape via the

<h2>4.3 Creating and editing shapefiles<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-and-editing-shapefiles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Shapefiles are added and modified using a plug-in called
<strong>Shapefile Editor</strong>. Remember to activate the plug-in first in the
<strong>Plug-ins</strong> menu. Doing so brings up a new toolbar that is used to run the plug-ins
various functions. All references to toolbar buttons below refer to the shapefile editors
toolbar. Note that this is a large toolbar and adding it can cause many of the other toolbars to
be hidden. To avoid this you can grab the toolbar along the row of dots, and drag it down one
row, or to wherever you want it.</p>
<p>A word of caution. The shapefile toolbar works on whatever layer happens to be selected in
the legend. If you accidentally switch layers at some point there will be no warning to let you
know that the target has changed. Furthermore, although the shapefile toolbar does have an
<strong>Undo</strong> button, it is not yet functional in version 4.8.6. That said, you do have
the option of setting the layer to
<strong>Editing mode</strong> in the
<strong>Mode</strong> tab of the
<strong>Layer Properties</strong> dialog. This allows you to discard all changes when ending the
editing session.</p>

<h3>4.3.1 Creating a new shapefile<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-new-shapefile" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Shapefiles are created using the
<strong>New</strong> toolbar button. Clicking
<strong>New</strong> brings up a dialog in which you specify the name and location for the new
file. You also select which type of shape you want: point, line, or polygon. Before creating a
new shapefile you should load a layer into your project to set the projection and to serve as a
spatial reference when adding your new shapes. Advanced techniques for georeferencing are beyond
the scope of this guide.</p>
<img alt="Coordinates" class="align-right" src="../../_images/mapwindow-coordinates.png" style="width: 285px; height: 47px;" />
<p>When a shapefile is created it is empty. To add freeform shapes use the
<strong>Add</strong> toolbar button. There are two options for defining vertices. The easiest is
to use the mouse each time you left-click a new vertex is added. When all the vertices have been
defined, right-click the mouse to finish. An alternative approach is to define vertices by typing
in their X and Y coordinates. A dialog is provided for this purpose when you click the
<strong>Add</strong> button. After you have entered the X and Y values click the checkmark to the
right to add the vertex. Then go on to the next, until you are done. Right-click to complete the
shape and exit. Note that the X and Y boxes track the current location of the mouse, so dont let
your mouse stray out of the dialog when entering the values or the values will be changed.</p>
<p>To add a regular shape (e.g., rectangle, circle, etc.) use the
<strong>Insert</strong> toolbar button. First, pick the type of shape you want by clicking the
<strong>Add this</strong> radio button of your choice. Next, fill in any required data (e.g.,
rectangle height and width). Then go to your map and click where you want the centroid of the new
shape to be. Repeated clicking will produce multiple shapes. Once all of your shapes have been
added click
<strong>Done</strong> in the dialog to exit.</p>

<h3>4.3.2 Modifying existing shapes<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-existing-shapes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The shapefile toolbar has three buttons for changing the shape of existing shapes:
<strong>Move vertex</strong>,
<strong>Add vertex</strong> and
<strong>Remove vertex</strong>. Vertices need not be visible to use these tools. When your mouse
passes over an existing vertex it will be displayed, allowing you to move it (click and drag) or
remove it (click) with the appropriate tool. If you are adding vertices, a new vertex will appear
under your mouse when it travels near a shape (click to add). If the vertices are not immediately
visible, wait a few seconds there is a slight lag when the tool initially loads. The shapes do
not have to be selected for the tools to work. Until the
<strong>Undo</strong> feature is functional it would be advisable to work with a copy of existing
maps when modifying vertices, not the original, since the changes are committed immediately.</p>
<p>To remove shapes from a layer they must first be selected. Then click the
<strong>Remove</strong> button to delete them. A warning box will pop up to ask you if you are
sure.</p>
